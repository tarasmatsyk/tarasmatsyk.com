## So you need a blog

I know, I know, the very first question I receive when people hear "How to setup a blog" is:
"Why the hell you need to setup a blog if Facebook, Blogger, Wordpress and Medium exist?"

If this is the first question that comes to you mind - you probably do not need one.
The only reason to have your own blog is a desire to have a control over it.

This is fine. Here are a few reasons for having a separate blog:

- adding contact me / about me / email subscription buttons
- being able to modify structure and the theme (at least it's fun)
- being able to work on SEO, not all blogging engine provide you with a good search optimization for you user name
- you control advertising (or absence of it, ADs are are cancer of 21th century and everyone tries to avoid it)
- custom domain and direct links to only your content (not distruction)
- and tons of other reasons you can think of

## Approved, where do we start?

I will go from the easiest option to the less easier which use. No need to get a bare metal or dedicated server from DigitalOcea, we are not enemy to ourselves.
In particular here we will be talking about Static Site Generators, yes, this is one more post on SSG. 
During last 2 month I've done an analysys of most popular solutions
